# CS1632_Exercise3
There appears to be only one problem with running the test using the example input.
Although I made sure to add sc.next() as specified in class, the program will not rever to asking the user "rent/return which cat?" after the user has attempted to input an invalid id number. 
After entering an invalid id number, the user will have to enter 2/3 for the option to rent or return a cat manually to try again.
Everything else should work as intended, however.
